In the previous chapter, we dove deep into an popular algorithm that is part of the classic approach of online RL. Sampling experience in the form of transition tuples by direct interactions with an environment, those methods do not require a predefined dataset. This greatly separates them from other machine learning disciplines like supervised or unsupervised learning.

In this chapter we introduce the reader to a different approach to reinforcement learning, \textit{Imitation Learning}. //TODO
