This chapter presents the setup, performance and weakness of a system that should learn representative vessel trajectories in order to generate and predict future paths. The overall system is built based on the findings of the synthetic experiments which were deeply discussed in the previous chapter \ref{chap:synthetic}.
\par
First, the process of handling historical AIS data and extracting ship trajectories is displayed. The resulting dataset acts as ground truth (GT) in the custom environment which is explained in the next subchapter. Afterwards, a generic metric is introduced which in return is used to describe the performance of the system and to discuss the results. Finally, we trace and analyse supposedly bad predictions to potentially discover patterns which lead to bad performances.
